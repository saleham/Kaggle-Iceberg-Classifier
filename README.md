# Kaggle-Iceberg-Classifier
This repository is a competition hosted on Kaggle for detecting whether the picture has a iceberg or a ship.
In this project I use two methods and at last by ensembling them I improve performance and avoid overfitting.
1- Feature extraction by diffrent filters and diffrent property of image .
2- Using deep learning (optimized CNN: using batch Normalization,image agmentation ,transfer learning using VGG16 , 
inception and other pretrained networks and other property that improve CNN performance)

by ensembilng of diffrent methods based on their single performance we get best of our model.
